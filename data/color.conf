#Configuration file for color - allows to colorize console output for different programs.
#
#color can be used as the following:
# [some-command] | color [color-scheme]
#
# where [color-scheme] can be either syslog, gcc or any of defined below
#
# there are three types of coloring rules:
#
# * color=[COLOR_NAME]:regular_expression
#    colorizes everything that matches regular_expression with COLOR_NAME. Colors are defined at bottom of this help.
#
# * color_full_line=[COLOR_NAME]:regular_expression
#    colorizes whole line of input, where the regular_expression was matched
#
# * alternate=[NUMBER]:[COLOR1],[COLOR2],[COLOR2],...,[COLORN]
#    colorizes first NUMBER of lines with COLOR1, then next NUMBER lines with COLOR2 and so on. Useful to distinguish between 
#    separate long lines of logs/template errors
#
# supported colors:
# BLACK, RED, GREEN, BROWN, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, GRAY, BOLD_BLACK, BOLD_RED, BOLD_GREEN, BOLD_BROWN, BOLD_BLUE, BOLD_MAGENTA, BOLD_CYAN, BOLD_GRAY, RESET
